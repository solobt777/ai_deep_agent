1. uv init
2. uv venv

4. create requirements.txt
    a. inorder to create basic deep agent - this deepagents is a standalone library for building agents that can that can tackle complex multi-step task. Uh this entire deepagents is build on langraph. and it is basically inspired from claude code, manu research that is available in open AI -- build on langraph -- it is specially used for creating multi AI agents complex work flows -- it has all the properties like
            - Stateful
            - state  (which can remember all the information with respect to the work flows, and it will be able to share the information across )
            - 
        - deepagents
        - langchain
        - langchain-openai
        -langchain-groq
        -ipkernel
5. in order add all this library use 
    uv add -r requirements.txt
6. - ipkernel (ipykernel is just for attaching the kernel to jupyter note book)
